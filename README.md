# DevCirclesAccountKitDemo
This is a sample app built for Android in React Native. This repo exists to support the code lab we ran during the August 2017 
Developer Circles Toronto meeting where we talked about Account Kit. 

You can clone this repo and simply study the code or you may use the instructions in [this Wiki page]
(https://github.com/rodnolan/DevCirclesAccountKitDemo/wiki/Implement-Email-Login-with-Account-Kit) 
to re-create this app from scratch.

At the time this README was written this repo was two months old so the dependency versions defined in package.json are not current. 
If you're a React Native developer, you understand how quickly things move in this space. If you're up to the task, run everything on 
the latest versions and do a pull request. PRs are ever welcome. #LongLiveOpenSource
